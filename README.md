# Code-First-Bank-Database



Developing a console application with a database that allows Customers of Federal Bank to create a user account and log in. In their account they can check their Account Information, Account Balance, Deposit, Withdraw, Transaction History, and edit their Account Settings.

In the application Federal Bank administrators may also log in (although with only 3 tries) and list all bank customers, edit customers, or remove customers.


To be implemented: Customer Account Settings, Edit Customers, Remove Customers, resetting Admin tries after 15 minutes.
